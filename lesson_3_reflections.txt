When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  So that you can share that work publicly, collaborate on it with others, and save a backup copy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Other people might change that repository, or it might interrupt your current local work for updates to occur without warning.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	You fork someone else's repository to have a version of it in your GitHub account. You clone a copy to get a copy onto your local machine. You make branches to make changes to different 'versions' of the code.
