How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It highlighted where the changes were that could be a source of problems.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

	By being able to identify the history of changes that were made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?	

	Better control over logical version points.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files 
in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?	

	Because the files are all related in Git, whereas in Google Docs they might not be.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Git log shows all the changes, and git diff highlights the specific lines that have changed between versions.	

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	Because you know you could find the source of any problem, and revert back to a state before it existed.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	Keeping proper version control on my work.
