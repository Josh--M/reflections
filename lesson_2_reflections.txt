What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a repo on an initial commit (no commits made yet) and notes any untracked files currently in that directory. To start tracking files/commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It has some changes from what's in the working directory, but it hasn't been saved into the respository. It provides an intermediate step for work to be done on a file before it is changed.
